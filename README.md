# reddit-intelligence

Automated Reddit research pipeline for LinkedIn content. Runs free on GitHub Actions — no servers, no infra.

Every morning at **05:30 IST** a GitHub Issue lands in your inbox with the day's top Reddit signal across AI, personal branding, VC/funding, and cybersecurity — pre-scored, pre-filtered, and pre-framed with LinkedIn angles. No manual scrolling. No noise.

---

## How it works

```
GitHub Actions (cron)
  → Composio Reddit API     (real upvote scores, no IP blocks)
  → processors/scorer.py   (engagement formula + content type + LinkedIn angle)
  → processors/digest.py   (compresses to ~500 tokens — zero noise)
  → GitHub Issue            (lands in your inbox automatically)
```

All intelligence runs as pure Python before Claude ever sees a token. Claude's job is creation only.

### Engagement scoring

```
engagement_score = (upvotes × 1.0) + (comments × 3.0)
```

Comments are weighted 3× because discussion depth predicts LinkedIn content value better than raw popularity.

### Content type classifier

Every post is auto-labeled before the digest is generated:

| Label | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| `ANNOUNCEMENT` | New release, launch, or update |
| `CVE` | Security vulnerability or exploit |
| `DISCUSSION` | Question or debate thread |
| `TUTORIAL` | Guide or how-to |
| `INSIGHT` | Research, data, or study |
| `MEME` | Only passes if score ≥ 1,000 (cultural moment) |

### LinkedIn angle map

Each `(category, content_type)` pair maps to a pre-written angle tag. No Claude tokens spent on figuring out what to write — only on writing it.

│   ├── latest_weekly.json      ← always the most recent weekly

```

## Setup (fork this repo)

### 1. Connect Reddit to Composio

Go to [app.composio.dev](https://app.composio.dev) → Apps → Reddit → Connect your account.

### 2. Get your Composio API key

[app.composio.dev](https://app.composio.dev) → Settings → API Keys → copy.

### 3. Add GitHub secret

Your repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret:

```
Name:  COMPOSIO_API_KEY
Value: your-composio-api-key
```

That's it. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatic — no other secrets needed.

### 4. Enable GitHub Issues

Your repo → Settings → Features → check **Issues**.

GitHub Actions will now:
- Create labeled Issues automatically (`daily-digest`, `weekly-research`)
- You get notified via GitHub's own push notification / email
- Issues are permanently searchable by label, date, keyword

---

## Schedules

| Workflow | Schedule | Output |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Daily scrape | Every day at 05:30 IST | Top posts of the day, scored + filtered |
| Weekly research | Sunday at 06:30 IST | Top posts of the week + comments + search intelligence |

Both workflows also have a **manual trigger** (Actions tab → Run workflow).

---

## Local run

```bash
pip install composio-core

export COMPOSIO_API_KEY=your-key-here

python scrapers/daily_scraper.py
python scrapers/weekly_scraper.py
```

---

## Using the digest with Claude

The daily Issue is ~500 tokens. Paste it and say:

> *"Write me 3 LinkedIn posts from this digest."*

Total Claude session: ~1,700 tokens vs ~25,000 tokens for raw Reddit data — **94% reduction** with better signal.
